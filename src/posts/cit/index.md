CIT mean grouping of culture, innovation and technology.
My friend created a studio, I was their web-developer.
Particially adaptive, valid and cross-browser. html, css, js.

Unfortunately, [web-archive not saved styles](http://web.archive.org/web/20121228092043/http://vkite.ru/).

But usually I save screenshots of my projects:
