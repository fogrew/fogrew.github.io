The purpose of these lessons is to explain language concepts in person in an offline format.

I added excerpts and footage from Kingsman to the slides about the event model in JavaScript, in order to dilute the new information with a familiar drive. It didn't make it any easier or clearer, but it was easier to understand.
If you're afraid of spoilers, don't open it.

[Epic Skills](https://epixx.ru/) are professionals with years of experience in various fields whose turbo engine is the desire to spread knowledge. I really wish they hadn't lost their offline base due to quarantine strain and could teach students there further. Right now they need financial support. [Help the guys?](https://donate.epixx.ru/)
