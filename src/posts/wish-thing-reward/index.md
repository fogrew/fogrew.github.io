## Criteria of doable things

<!-- TODO: нужно больше предислвия о том, зачем все эти сложности -->
I'm not pay attention to things, if they not fit into chain «wish → thing → reward».

**Wish** to get, achieve, try, change something - is required predecessor for almost each my action, for any task in my System. Often I want to eliminate some problem, strive to dreams, want to get something, honestly want to help someone.

**Reward** I'll get, if done a thing or group of things. It's result which I achieve after doing things. I will be glad to delicious if I go to the grocery. I will be proud of the article if I write it. The result should at least like or be interesting, otherwise it is not a reward. If this is not a reward, then I will not do the task.

**Thing** should logically come from wish and after its implementation, I must logically come to a reward. Otherwise, I will not take care of them.

In words, I am Lev Tolstoy, but in fact... let's deep dive into the examples. Because not everything is so clear.

## False desires

### Imposed desires

Is the worst motivation. Voices either in the head or others, speaking "Everyone does it like that", "You can't do it, you're a weak", "Eat less to find the husband", "Protect girls like a real man", "Feed husband like a real woman" - all these are echoes of *violent communication*, echoes of obsolete principles of life in society. It can also be called *external motivation*.

If I have no internal motivation to do the requested - I will not do. For example:

* Trying to lose weight to get praise hurts yourself. The same desire for your health is useful.
* Growing your career for your parents approval will lead to wasted years. But not for your own dreams.

### Invisible transactions

тоже история не из лучших. Они тоже являются навязанными желаниями. "Не служил в армии - не мужик", "сделай по-братски", "ты меня уважаешь", "ты мне друг или нет", "одеваешься как деревенщина", "ты **ДОЛЖЕН**". Но ведь должный - это тот, кто брал в долг, верно?

Получается, я взял в долг у страны за право рождения, у друзей за право уважения, у общества за право… соответствовать его стандартам. Где-то тут кислинка чувствуется.

Разве нельзя как-то менее уничижительно по отношению к себе? Ведь можно. Можно откосить от армии. Можно выбирать друзей и окружение, которые ценят тебя за то, кто ты есть, а не за соответствие их стандартам.

### One-day desires

Which is needed only today, but tomorrow will be useless

### Garbage desires

These are one-day desires, which in the short term benefit, and in the long-term - harm.

### Burdening debts

washing dishes, tidying

### Unjustified desires

cuz it's funny

### Better world

**But what if I'll avoid this rule?** Sometimes I do something not for myself. If I do not promise, then at least I take the obligation to make the agreed. I say, "I will do". When this happens, I feel I owe. The same way I would feel if I borrowed money. In such situations, I often do not notice that their request is toxic for me for lack of internal motivation. I don't like being in debt. Sometimes I think about violence that I agreed to make with myself only after the request is fulfilled. It is always unpleasant to think and talk about this. And it's also unpleasant to talk about how to avoid repetition of violence against yourself. But if I don't "work on the mistakes", then I will repeat the mistake from time to time.

**Work on the mistakes**. For example, I will discuss that such requests are unpleasant for me, I will ask you to ask my opinion and warn that next time I can refuse. This must be carefully served so as not to seem a douchebag. But it pays off: toxic abuse are surrounded by less, and more courteous and kind people - more. The choice is for me: I respect myself or not.

General rule: My desires should be for me. Otherwise, they are external, imposed, false.
