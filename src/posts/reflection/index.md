Reflection can be used wherever there are emotions and a desire to change something. In work, personal things, relationships.

**Reflection is the practice of rationalizing emotions** and a way to reduce or avoid negative emotion antecedents and increase the repetition of positive ones.

## Goals of reflection

We often make decisions without thinking, because we have already faced similar situations.

It's like we're in a dark cave: we're following the obvious path along the wall -along the only thing we can feel. We forget about the opportunity to light a lantern.

Often, because of strong emotions, we do not try to understand what really was the problem. Instead of looking for real premises, we call what we feel a problem.

1. The first goal of reflection is to **separate the consequences of the prerequisites**, remove the assessment of events and people, find rational facts that gave rise to the consequences or their chain. Every consequence obviously has a premise behind it. Perhaps not one, but many. When we are in a strong emotion (outraged by a single consequence), we can easily miss facts that may be just as important. If you find only one, fixing it may not lead to the desired result.
2. The second purpose of reflection is to **find all premises** that were not immediately obvious. After separating the wheat from the chaff, you can begin to analyze the prerequisites - real problems that actually make sense to work on.
3. The main goal of reflection is to **plan actions** that will help reduce or avoid the repetition of negative facts, as well as increase the repetition of positive ones.

## How to do a reflection

It is important not to dissemble yourself, not to smooth the corners and be able to calmly judge what causes emotions. It is important to write down everything in text (to have an artifact of reflection), otherwise there is a great chance of distorting the wording along the way, which will devalue the work done at each step.

### Facilitate reflection

1. **Invite everyone involved**. If it is clear in advance that there are expectations of a change in people's behavior, they should be invited to this meeting: this way they will see not only a request to change behavior, but also be able to understand the prerequisites and consequences.
2. **Fix timing**. It is important to agree in advance on which step how much time will be allocated. You can't discuss 200 emotions in 10 minutes.
3. **Announce Format**. If the participants came to throw out their emotions and are not ready to do something about it, reflection will not work. Agree to go ahead with the plan.
4. **Adjust the conversation**. Don't let it get off-topic. Group emotions and concerns whenever possible.
5. **Agree**. If there is a dispute about the wording, look for a middle ground that suits the parties. If it is not possible to agree, perhaps there is another emotion that requires reflection.
6. **Rationalize and refine**. If there are generalizations, get specific.
7. **Follow the sequence of steps**. If on the steps after emotions, a lot of emotions arise, you need to change the wording so that what can be called the word fact remains.

### Reflection Steps

1. The first step is to **write down the emotions** as they sound in your head. Not trying to decide right away, not skipping steps, not jumping to a solution. Examples of emotions: "enrages that John ignores my requests", "demotivates bugs on the production", "depresses that my requests are ignored", "I get high when I manage to complete the sprint goal", "love my team".
2. Then it is worth **checking emotionality:** whether the emotions written out are already prerequisites. What do you feel about it? If the fact does not cause emotions, reflection will not help. A property of strong emotion: it begins with a descriptive verb. Examples of such verbs: "irritates", "enrages", "frustrates", "depresses", "demotivates", "likes", "rejoice", "get high", "thank". An example of a fact without emotion in work: "we don't write unit-tests". An example of an emotion found in this fact: "I feel like a bad developer when bugs are found in my task that I could easily prevent", "I worry that other developers will break part of my feature during its completion and will not notice it".
3. The next step is good to **prioritize**. It's about how strongly the evoked emotion affects its author. It is not allowed to prioritize other people's emotions. What one doesn't care about at all may worry another very much. It doesn't matter how the priority is arranged. Zero to 100 as percentages, 1 to 5 or F to A as school grades, XXS to XXXL as T-shirt sizes. It does not matter whether the priority will be repeated for different items. It is good to immediately agree on extremes. An example for reflection at work: "a hundred means that if the emotion is repeated, I will be ready to leave the company, and zero means that I myself do not understand why I wrote it." An example for family reflection: "a hundred means that I'm filing for divorce, zero means that we should ignore it." An example for individual reflection: "a hundred - ~~I'm cutting myself out of life~~ I'm going to a psychologist, zero - I don't write it down, or I'm looking for the true wording that made me want to write it down."
4. It's good to **filter out the least hot emotions**, so you don't get bogged down in reflection. For example, remove all emotions with a priority below 60 on a scale from zero to one hundred.

6. Find the problem
7. Find other problems
8. Try to find the way how to reduce risks of current situation
9. Try to find how to avoid repeating of each problem
