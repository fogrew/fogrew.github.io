ðŸ—¯ Briefly: what do you want â†’ what now â†’ what can you â†’ what will you do

**Goal** - What purpose would you like to achieve? How do you understand that the goal has been achieved?

**Reality** - What has already been done for this goal? Who else is involved in this process? What progress? What disturb/prevents the goal? And what helps to?

**Options** - What options do you have? What can be done? Who else can be involved in the process? Where can you find information? What steps can you do? What could have been, what worked before?

At this step, it is important not to give recommendations, to keep his opinion with him so that a person can show a brainstorming.You can formulate the issue with sentences, about risks.

**Will** - What do you intend to do? When? With whom? Assessment of its determination. Can something to disturb?

Nothing to do on the task is also a result, if it's the solution for person.
