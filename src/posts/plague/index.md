And it bam - and it works! For the first time in several years felt at the peak of modernity by code.

Code: https://nights.site/Nights/plague
Demo: http://plague.jkoff.ru/ (already turned off)

Essence of project is to watch the honestly of voting on the website of governor of Yaroslavl city and the possibility then to demonstrate not only the data recieved from site, but also screenshots (the "commom person" no longer believes in their eyes).
