Now I dropped this my email address in yandex, that's why project in GitHub already deprecated and archived.

Code: https://github.com/fogrew/yandex-mail-app

If you from Yandex, please, make separate application. It will be very useful for your clients.

If I violate any rules, please notify me about it 🙏
I did not have any selfish goals when creating, I just wanted to improve my expierence of interaction with mail application🤷🏻
