For correspondence, use email and<!-- anti-spam@here.gmail -->rew&commat;gurylev<!-- anti-spam@here.gmail -->&period;com.

## How I protect our correspondence

* My email is located in the cloud of the Proton mail service, on Swiss servers (under Swiss laws)
* My account is protected by 2FA with physical key
* I receive and send mail only through official clients, which protects against the interception of letters on the way from me and to me

## How to start private correspondence with me

Encrypt the message with PGP and send it ([see instructions on free software foundation site](https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/)).

My PGP key: [985FE55E](/keys/pgp_keys.asc){rel="pgpkey authn"}

Be sure to share your PGP public key with me not in plain-text email, so I can add you to my contacts and encrypt the reply email.

Keep in mind that with PGP, the body of the email is always encrypted, but the subject of the email is transmitted in plain-text and the fact that there is encrypted correspondence is available to a potential interceptor.

## How to start really private correspondence with me

If you want to discuss something really privately, invite me to coffee in the park.
