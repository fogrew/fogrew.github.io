For open correspondence, use email: [andrew@gurylev.com](mailto:andrew@gurylev.com){rel="me" .u-email}

### Pretty Good Privacy

You can contact me more privately. Just encrypt the message with PGP before sending, and send me your public PGP key (or say from which key-server I can get it).

My PGP key: [985FE55E](/keys/pgp_keys.asc){rel="pgpkey authn"}

### Special cases

I have a special email: [fogrew@pm.me](mailto:fogrew@pm.me){rel="me" .u-email}

It is located in the cloud of the ProtonMail mail service, on Swiss servers.

PGP key: [955C5182](/keys/publickey.fogrew@pm.me.asc){rel="pgpkey authn"}

If it means something to you, you know what to do.
