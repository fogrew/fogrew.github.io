[Epic Skills](https://epixx.ru/) are professionals with years of experience in various fields whose turbo engine is the desire to spread knowledge. I really wish they hadn't lost their offline base due to quarantine strain and could teach students there further. Right now they need financial support. [Help the guys?](https://donate.epixx.ru/)
